      Test equality of lists.
      
      Lists are considered equal if they have the same number of elements and
      each element is equal to the element from the other list at the same
      position.
      
      Lists cannot be compared using `==` unless the elements in one list
      can be compared to the corresponding elements of the other list using
      `==`.
